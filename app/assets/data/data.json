Despite the roadblock of missing the Final Four for the first time in 11 years, the Blue Eagles return with the same mission: to assert their place among the UAAP’s elite.\n\nKey holdovers Jared Bahay, Andrew Bongo, Ian Espinosa, Kyle Gamber, Josh Lazaro, and Shawn Tuano anchor a hungry squad that is determined to restore Ateneo’s winning tradition. Supporting the Blue and White’s bid for glory will be recruits Divine Adili, Kymani Ladi, Jaden Lazo, and Dominic Escobar—bolstering both the frontcourt and backcourt rotations with invaluable depth.\n\nWith a mix of motivated veterans and standout acquisitions, Espinosa believes uniting under Head Coach Tab Baldwin’s championship-proven system will unlock the team’s full potential. Fueled by the same culture and camaraderie that powered the dynasties of the past, the Blue Eagle Band of Brothers are primed to once again emerge as threats in the UAAP.",
